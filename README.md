# Caesar's Cipher Implementation
This is a C++ implementation of Caesar's cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places.

Features
Encoding: Encode plaintext using a specified shift (cypher).
Decoding: Automatically decode ciphertext using frequency analysis.
